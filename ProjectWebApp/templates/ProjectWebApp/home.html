            <h2>1. Optimización de la Operación de Centrales de Energía</h2>
            <p>
                Power plants can adjust their production based on multiple factors such as demand, fuel prices, and weather conditions. The goal of this task is to create a model that helps optimize the operation of power plants by recommending settings for optimal efficiency.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
